This is help Text
Although Very Limited, this should help you to
use this better, although there's an
HTML documentation is available at 
html-help

Menu:
There are 3 Options, the other 2 are just basic stuff
Change and Restore

Change -
    is a Feature to change '~$' to 
    '<insertyourinput>'
    a Dialog Input box will meet you and
    require you to input anything.
    if you see \w, it's just a function
    to check directory, (Check the
    GNU Bash Help Wizard Page)
    you can just 
    remove it if unnecessary, but
    i recommend you to leave that 
    if you want to know where is
    your current directory location

Restore -
    Restoring the Bash Script to normal
    
Fix -
    Although, same as Restore,
    this one just fix if you have missing
    bashrc
    

End of help
